### 🏡 Housing Price Analysis & Storytelling with Pandas

This project explores a Kaggle housing dataset and uncovers key insights about the real estate market using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Data Visualization** tools. The goal is not only to analyze numbers but to tell a **data-driven story** that reveals patterns in pricing, features, and buyer preferences.

### 📌 Size Isn’t Everything
- A 16,200 sq.ft. house sold for ₹10.15M, while a 7,420 sq.ft. house fetched ₹13.3M.
- Furnishing and amenities significantly influenced the value per square foot.
